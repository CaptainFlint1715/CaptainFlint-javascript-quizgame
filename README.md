# JavaScript Quiz Game by Captain Flint

## Description

This repository was built for the purpose of providing an online quiz by which users may test their knowledge of basic JavaScript. From scratch I developed an interface enabling users to navigate the page using clearly marked buttons and utilized distinct styling to create a holistic quiz experience - complete with a responsive timer and locally stored and viewable scoring.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Click the "start game" button to begin the quiz. Each wrong answer will subtract 3 seconds from the 30-second timer. When finished, you may input initials and save score.
